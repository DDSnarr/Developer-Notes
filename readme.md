# Notes

- After downloading a zip file, **extract** it to your `Udemy` directory(folder). Make a directory for each section of the course and move stuff around to keep it organized.


## Commands to make it easier to work on a laptop

**For Chrome:**
- Use `ALT+TAB` to cycle through different open windows
- Use `CTRL+T` to create a new tab
- Use `CTRL+SHIFT+TAB` to open your closed tabs
- Use `CTRL+W` to close the current tab
- Push down on the scroll wheel to close tabs and to open links in new tabs

**For VSCode**
- Use `CTRL /` to comment out a section 
- Use `CTRL+SHIFT+P` to get to the command palette to run commands
- Use `` CTRL+` `` to open the `terminal`


## Git workflow
Periodically, or after you are done with some work, you should `push` it to github to back it up. It's good practice for the real world where they use this extensively.

To do this
1. click on the "Source Control" section on the left sidebar inside VSCode.
2. click the plus icon (`+`) of the files you want to "push" (probably all of them)
3. type a commit message and press `CTRL+ENTER` or press the check button
4. Press `Sync your changes`

Now, all the changes will be in github :)
